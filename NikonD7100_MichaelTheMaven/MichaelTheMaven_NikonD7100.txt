=======================================================


Impact of Focal Lense
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Large focal lense (Zoom) ->		Background larger and closer
	(Narrow field of view)			No deep background. Primary subject surrounded by backgroun.
									Background spread
									Bakground bigger
									Vertical lines diverting \/
									Back shorter than front (for same real length)
									Horizontal lines parallels

	Small focal lense (Macro) ->	Background smaller and further
	(Wide field of view)			Background compressed
									Feeling of deep, projected background
									Background smaller
									Vertical lines converging /\
									Back bigger than front (for same real length)
									Horizontal lines curved \______/ (in extreme case, 20mm orless)
									Nose and body distorted (flat nose, bigger body) for 20 mm or less

Depth of field:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Proportional to:
		Distance to subject
		Focal length
	Inverse to:
		Aperture
	Shallow DOF: close to subject, big aperture, telephoto
	Deep DOF: away from subject, small aperture, wide lens

Composition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Rule of thirds
	Dealing with subject
		Give dimension to objects (shoot from one side)
		Angle of attack to change perception
		Distance to subject and amount of subject in frame
		Perspective of subjects to control the relative size of different subjects:
			Get closer to the main subject
			Distance the subjects
			Use of different focal length
	Surrounding:
		Sense of depth by getting guiding lines
		Avoid distractions, preferably by compsition
		Use contrast wtih background to hightlight shape of subjects
	Texture:
		Pattern that repeats
	Overexposure: Too much light for the sensor to be distinguised and processed

Camera Modes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	While being on S mode, if the camera can't get enough exposure with the lense aperture, the chosen aperture (max. aperture), will blink. 
		This will tell you that there is not enough light (or too much) that could compensated.
	Camera options:
		Shutter speed
		Aperture
		ISO
		White Balance
		Metering
		Focus Drive
		Comperession Format
	Use the exposure compensation when you want to mantain the aperture desired (A mode) or shutter speed desired (S mode) and still the exposure is not what you wanted.
	When it's too dark, compensate with more light, when too bright, compensate with less light.
	Backlight subject: When shooting with light in front, aim to the sides/bottom where no sun is shining, and press AE-L (Auto exposure lock). This will lock the aperture/shutter speed. Then, proceed normally.
	Play with AE-L/AF-L **
	Play with minimum shutter speed and auto ISO in Aperture Mode, Shutter Speed Priority and Manual mode
	Menu:
		Press ok or move right
		Press menu or left to go back

Camera customizations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	AE-L Lock the auto exposure with half-press (c-1) **
