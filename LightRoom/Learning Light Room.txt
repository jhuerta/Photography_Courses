	TIPS:
		Black and Whites: To select a nice point, hold alt key while dragging the slider whites or blacks. The whole image turns black (or white) and move the slider until you see a bit part of the white or black area. That would be a good starting poing for the white and blacks.
		Clarity: Adds texture. Good to apply when there is no people.
		Vibrance: Boost up colors except skin colors. It is kind inteligent saturation, it only applies saturations for those colors needed.
		Saturation is for everything.
